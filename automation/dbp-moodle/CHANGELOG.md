# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Image Updates
- **OPS-10494** Update Moodle Tools
  - Bump Version of moodle-tools to 1.2.0

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-26
### Feature
- **DBP-2419** Replace Redis with valkey
  - Based on license changes and usage of bitnami-redis we adjust the bundled key-value store to valkey
  - To switch from redis to valkey set 'dbpMoodle.valkey.enabled: true' and 'dbpMoodle.redis.enabled: false'
  - The official valkey image is used https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey/
- **DBP-2468** Integrate course reminder plugin
  - Added new Plugin: course reminder
  - Can be enabled via `global.moodlePlugins.local_course_reminder.enabled`

### Fix
- gpg key handling after debian13 upgrade
  - With the helm chart created secret for the gpg keys, there was still the old naming "gpgkey.dbpinfra.pub.asc"
    which needed adjustment after the debian13 update to match the new configuration and was renamed to "gpgkey.devops.pub.asc".
    In case the chart created secret is used, one needs to adjust the helm chart values to hand over the gpg keys to the chart.
  - The expected type of gpg_key_names is a List and was now changed from the default empty string, to a default empty List.

### Changes
  -  Use Image 4.5.12-fpm-trixie-8.2.31-dbp6 as default

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-24
### Fix
- **PB-161**: Change plugin source to moodle marketplace from moodle plugin directory
  - Using a new moodle default image in Helm Chart Version 1.6.1: 4.5.12-fpm-trixie-8.2.31-dbp2
  - This skips the installation and update check of the mod_booking plugin as its currently not available via any plugin source

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-29
### Changed
- **PB-149**: Bump Moodle Version from 4.5.10 to 4.5.12
  - Use new Moodle default Image in Helm Chart Version 1.6.1: 4.5.12-fpm-trixie-8.2.31-dbp1

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-24
### Changed
- **PB-128**: Update to Debian 13 Trixie
  - Helm Chart GPG Key way of working adjusted
    - Affected Helm value: Values.dbpMoodle.backup.gpg_key_names
      - This value will now be handled in the helpers.tpl to create dbpMoodle.backup.gpg_key_names.cmd which is used during runtime to create the Keys to the key names.
    - Because of the adjustements, the way the GPG Keys are handled were adjusted. If multiple Keys are used, the input in the values.yaml should be a List of Strings like this: ["Key1Name", "Key2Name"]
  - Image Update to increase the debian Version from 12(Bookworm) to 13(Trixie) to ensure continuous security update support.
    - Updated Moodle Image to '4.5.10-fpm-trixie-8.2.31-dbp1'
    - Updated Moodle-Tools Image to '1.1.15'

### Fix
- **DBP-2357**: Add startup probe
    - Larger Instances need more time during the startup, exceeding the delay of the liveness probe
    - This leads to pod terminations and restarts during version updates, which might lead to a corrupted state
    - To prevent this the usage of a startup probe is introduced by default which only terminates the pod after ~20 Minutes
    - If more time is needed this can be adjusted via `.Values.moodle.startupProbe.failureThreshold` and `.Values.moodle.startupProbe.failureThreshold.periodSeconds`

## [1.5.0]
### Feature
- **DM-272**: Support for both oidc and eledia_oidc plugins
    - Added the `.Values.global.noodlePlugins.eledia_oidc` field
    - Set this to enabled if the eledia implementation of oidc should be used (relevant for the ZIT instances)
    - If `.Values.global.noodlePlugins.oidc.enabled` was true prior to this change set it to false and set `eledia_oidc` to true instead.
    - Use `oidc` from now on to use the regular auth_oidc plugin and `eledia_oidc` to use the custom extension by eledia.
    - These plugins should be used mutually exclusive.
    - Updated Moodle Image to '4.5.10-fpm-bookworm-8.2.30-dbp10' containing the plugin

### Fix
- **DBP-2270**: ssl-proxy
    - Added '$CFG->sslproxy = true;' to the php-config
    - This way moodle expects the tls-termination prior to the apache webserver and can handle it properly
    - Solves problems where json responses were wrapped in htlm code due to errors

## [1.4.1]
### Fix
- **PB-70**: Mailserver Configuration
    - Added "smtpExistingSecret" to moodle chart, which allows to set the mail servers secret via an existing secret
    - With `.Values.moodle.smtpExistingSecret` the secret can now be adjusted and if used the `smtp-password` key is expected to hold the password.
    - Use this to setup the smtp server config via IaC in combination with 
      - smtpHost: ""
      - smtpPort: ""
      - smtpUser: ""
      - smtpProtocol: ""

## [1.4.0]

### Feature
- **DBP-2304**: Add Plugin tool_mediatime
  - Added `.Values.global.noodlePlugins.tool_mediatime.enabled`
  - Updated Moodle Image to '4.5.10-fpm-bookworm-8.2.30-dbp9' containing the plugin 

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **DBP-2274**: Add default chart values for the etherpad database in the backup-cronjob config.
    - DATABASE_HOST_ETHERPAD, DATABASE_PORT_ETHERPAD, DATABASE_NAME_ETHERPAD, DATABASE_USER_ETHERPAD are all filled via the automatically created etherpad-db-secret and configured via etherpadlite.externalDatabase by default
    - DATABASE_PASSWORD_ETHERPAD references the moodle secret and expects by default an etherpad-postgresql-password key in that secret. If this is not supported in your setup it must be adjusted by overriding the env block with the according values.

### Changed
- Image Update
  - Updated Moodle Image to '4.5.10-fpm-bookworm-8.2.30-dbp8'

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **DBP-2263**: Adjusted plugin-list config map to work with empty MOODLE_PLUGINS_SYS_UNINSTALL properly
  - moodle-plugins cm now always contains the key "moodle-plugin-sys-uninstall-list", which is empty if .Values.dbpMoodle.uninstallSystemPlugins is false

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-14

### Removed

- **DBP-2080**: Removed Support for custom certificates and volume permission adjustments via initContainers
  - Removed `.Values.moodle.certificates` section in `values.yaml` as we dont need custom certificates in the container
  - Removed `.Values.moodle.volumePermissions` section in `values.yaml` as this was implemented by bitnami to Change the owner and group of the persistent volume mountpoint to runAsUser:fsGroup values from the securityContext section in kubernetes settings that had issues with this, which is not the case in our setup.
  - Both setups required an initContainer which used bitnamis os-shell container, to reduce bitnami dependencies and unused code this was removed entirely
- **DBP-2264**: Removed Support for secretFiles
  - Removed `.Values.moodle.usePasswordFiles` and all the according implementations.
